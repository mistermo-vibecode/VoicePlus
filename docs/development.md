# Development

## Project Setup

To run the project, open it in the latest version of Android Studio and build as usual.
VoicePlus requires **JDK 21**; the Gradle toolchain resolves it automatically via the Foojay convention.

The default development variant is `libreDebug`. It needs no Google services or credentials — VoicePlus has no Firebase,
analytics, or remote config. Release builds use the `libre` flavor.

By default, there is not enough memory configured for Gradle. You can fix this by running:

```sh
scripts/gradle_bootstrap.sh
```

This configures your global `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` to use more memory, depending on your machine.
Check the `gradle_bootstrap.sh` script for exact details.

## Tests

### Unit tests

To run the unit tests, run the following command:

```sh
./gradlew voiceUnitTest
```

### Instrumentation tests

To run the instrumentation tests, run the following command:

```sh
./gradlew voiceDeviceLibreDebugAndroidTest
```

## Ktlint

VoicePlus uses **Ktlint** to enforce consistent code formatting.

- Check for formatting issues:

```sh
./gradlew lintKotlin
```

- Auto-fix formatting:

```sh
./gradlew formatKotlin
```

- To make commits fail on formatting errors, set up a pre-commit hook:

```sh
echo "./gradlew lintKotlin" > .git/hooks/pre-commit
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

## Releasing

To release a new version, push a `vMAJOR.MINOR` tag, or dispatch the
[Release Workflow](https://github.com/Mistermo-vibecode/VoicePlus/actions/workflows/release.yml) manually.

The workflow builds a signed `libre` release APK and publishes it as a draft GitHub release. F-Droid picks up the binary
from the release a few days later.

CI signs the APK from base64-encoded keystore secrets. The release requires these secrets:

| Secret              | Purpose                                  |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `KEYSTORE_BASE64`   | Release keystore, base64 encoded.        |
| `KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` | Release keystore password.               |
| `KEY_ALIAS`         | Release key alias.                       |
| `KEY_PASSWORD`      | Release key password.                    |

## Versioning

VoicePlus uses simple `MAJOR.MINOR` versions (e.g. `1.30`), set as `versionName` and `versionCode` in
[`app/build.gradle.kts`](../app/build.gradle.kts). Each release is tagged `vMAJOR.MINOR`.
